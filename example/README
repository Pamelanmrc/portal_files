To run and produce the files in the output folder run the script  "make_file_portal_JSON.pl" using the file  "Projects_input" as the input parameter as shown below:


perl make_file_portal_JSON.pl Projects_input


==================== WAYS TO MAKE SURE IT RUNS ======================

1. Make sure the "Projects_input" file is tab-delimited duh!
2. Make sure you do not add "Proj_" in the first column of the "Projects_input" file.
3. Make sure that the "correct" JSON file name is used for the second column of the "Projects_input" file.
4. Make sure that the input JSON  file  has  the same name in the Projects_input file. 
5. You  can specify  the full path to the  input JSOB  file.
